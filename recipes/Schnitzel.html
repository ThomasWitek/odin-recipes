  <h2>A traditional Alpine dish.</h2>
    <p>A thin meat dish traditionally made in Bavaria, Austria and Switzerland. Generally served alongside Kartoffelsalat, a vinegary and tart potato salad, Preiselbeeren (Lingonberries). I generally like to make a dry sauerkrauet salad as my side of choice along with spaetzle (noodles). </p>

  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat of choice (Chicken, Beef, Pork loin, Turkey etc).</li>
        <li>Bread Crumbs</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Milk or Cream</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Flavorless Oil to Fry</li>
        <li>Lemon</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Prepare meat. Butterfly cut large meat products(i.e. Pork loin or chicken breasts). One can also hammer meat thin and until tender as well. The meat should be very thin.</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste all of the meat.</li>
    <li>Place eggs (beaten) into a bowl with half of an egg shell of milk or cream mixed in, flour on a plate, and bread crumbs onto a seperate plate.</li>
    <li>Heat a skillet on the stove at roughly half heat (maybe slightly more depending on ones range). Put enough oil in to fill roughly 1/4 to 1/2 inches of the skillet.</li>
    <li>Once oil is hot (water droplet pops when added to shimmering oil) batter the meat by first running the filet through flour, then the egg mixture, followed by the bread crumbs.</li>
    <li>Do not prepare bread the cutlets until the frying pan is clear. Cook individual cutlets in oil, gently shaking the skillet regularly and flipping the Schnitzel after about 1:30 to 2 minutes (both sides).</li>
    <li>Remove from pan when browned.</li>
    <li>Serve with lemon.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
